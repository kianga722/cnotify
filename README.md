## Summary

* Built primarily using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the edmtrain API
* Displays events from the API based on a selected list of artists
* Allows for further filtering by categories such as Venue, Recently Added, Month, etc.
* Sends daily e-mail notifications about new events (using Heroku Scheduler)

## Future Improvements

* Incorporate more sources besides edmtrain API (Ticketfly, Ticketmaster, StubHub, etc.)
* Allow filtering by more than 1 category at a time
